Since every tiddler in this structure has 2 tags 

* A group tag: `tag` -- and 
* A structural tag: `tag-??`

The structure below shows both of them. That's intended. ''But'' the breadcrumbs shown in the top of the view-template only show 1 path. That's intended too

See: [[tag-template]]

<div class="tc-table-of-contents">
<<toc-selective-expandable "tag">>
</div>
