! Bundle Lists

Using bundled lists is the easiest way to export a selection of related tiddlers. 

!! Info

Bundle lists are standard tiddlers

* Where the text field contains a whitespace-separated list of tiddler titles
* Tiddlers with spaces need to be covered in double-braces like so: `[[Title with spaces]]`
* Comments are similar to tiddlers with spaces but start with `[[--- ` 
** So `[[--- Lines starting with [[--- are treated as comments. ---]]` is bundler-plugin specific convention. Such tiddlers are //not// counted as tiddlers
** Comment tiddlers are also ''not exported'' since usually they do not exist
** So if you want to see the "comment tiddlers" you'll need to export the bundle-configuration tiddler too
