\custom angle="hard-linebreak" _classes=".hl"
\custom angle _use="hard-linebreak"

! Basic Usage pattern

~TiddlyWiki paragraphs are automatically detected, if plain text is followed by 2 linebreaks: `\n\n`.
This paragraph is such an example. ...
It also contains a single linebreak right after the 3 dots in the prior sentence. This single linebreak is ignored by the TW default rendering mechanism. 

There is a possibility to define "hard linebreaks" with a wikitext rule like: 

```
"""
line 1 
{{test}}
line 2 
"""
```

The tripple double-quotes are OK, but it should be easier. Especially if a lot of text is "copy / pasted" into a tiddler from a different souce. 

There is a possibilty to define a `\custom` pragma now. 

```
\custom angle="hard-linebreak" _classes=".hl"
\custom angle _use="hard-linebreak"
```
